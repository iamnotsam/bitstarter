        <h1><i>Codename:</i> Paincakes</h1>
        <h2>The refreshingly simple interval workout timer</h2>
        <h3>What's the problem?</h3>
        <p>There are some good interval timers out there, but they are specific to a certain platform, making it difficult for trainers, students, and workout buddies to truly share the workout experience.</p>
        <h3>Solution?</h3>
        <p>For this class, I will be building the interval timer I have been craving. I will employ the help of fellow fitness enthusiasts and trainers to define and hone the caliber of timer we all deserve.</p>
        <h3>What, no fundraising?</h3>
        <p>I do design and development, and I had a job I love. I don't really want to go further with this concept than to make it awesome. I can do that with the help from my friends who are into working out and who will test and critique the iterations of <strong>paincakes</strong>.
        <h3>The needs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to see from across the room</li>
          <li>Audio cues are loud and clear</li>
          <li>Works well for all major interval schemes like HIIT, Tabata, etc.</li>
          <li>Attractive design</li>
          <li>Easily adjust intervals with a few touches</li>
          <li>Smart defaults reduce time spent touching phone</li>
          <li>Works the same on Android and iOS devices like iPhone, iPad, and iPod</li>
          <li>Shows current time clearly</li>
          <li>Allows pausing/playing, no big deal</li>
          <li>Easily skip ahead to next exercise or return to previous exercise via simple arrow buttons</li>
          <li>Customize your interval routine ever how you want</li>
          <li>Save your customized routines to your library</li>
          <li>Choose other routines from other libraries</li>
          <li>Share that you've completed a routine with Twitter or Facebook</li>
          <li>If two people are really near to one another using the Tabata, the cue sounds should be different</li>          
        </ul>
